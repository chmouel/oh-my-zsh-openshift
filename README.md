## Synopsis

This is a `oh-my-zsh` plugin to provide shell completion of the OpenShift v3 commands with ZSH.

`oh-my-zsh` is a zsh framworks making it easy to customise your ZSH Shell. You can find out more about it here :

http://ohmyz.sh/

## Motivation

There is a bash completion in the openshift source that are autogenerated by OpenShift but I never got it to work with `bashcompctl`  or even with bash directly under MacosX so I wrote my own from scratch.

## Installation

Install `oh-my-zsh` if you haven't it installed following this :

https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/#basic-installation

and execute this :

> $ git clone https://github.com/chmouel/oh-my-zsh-openshift ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/oc

you can edit your ~/.zshrc and add `oc` to the `plugins` variable like for example :

> plugins=(oc git)
