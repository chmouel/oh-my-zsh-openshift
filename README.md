**Note that lately zsh completion should work out of the box with openshift origin, you just have to do a ```source <(oc completion zsh)``` from your shell and it should give you completion. There is still things that this plugin do better in some cases but down the line the effort should be focused on improving the completion inside openshift-origin**

## Synopsis

This is a `oh-my-zsh` plugin to provide shell completion of the OpenShift v3 commands with ZSH.

`oh-my-zsh` is a zsh framworks making it easy to customise your ZSH Shell. You can find out more about it here :

http://ohmyz.sh/

## Motivation

There is a bash completion in the openshift source that are autogenerated by OpenShift but I never got it to work with `bashcompctl`  or even with bash directly under MacosX so I wrote my own from scratch.

## Installation

Install `oh-my-zsh` if you haven't it installed following this :

https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/#basic-installation

and execute this :

> $ git clone https://github.com/chmouel/oh-my-zsh-openshift ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/oc

you can edit your ~/.zshrc and add `oc` to the `plugins` variable like for example :

> plugins=(oc git)

## Installation without oh-myzsh

I actually don't use `oh-my-zsh` so if you want to use the vanilla zsh you can just checkout this to a directory  like `~/.zsh/oc`  :

> $ mkdir -p ~/.zsh/;git clone https://github.com/chmouel/oh-my-zsh-openshift ~/.zsh/oc

## Configure (after install both with and without oh-my-zsh)

In your `~/.zshrc` put thing like this :

```bash
typeset -U fpath  # Optinal for oh-my-zsh users
fpath=(~/.zsh/oc $fpath)
autoload -U compinit
compinit -i
```
